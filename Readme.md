# React TDD

This is a simple one component app which uses one other object from it get a list of images and display them.

It's useful as a starting point, if:

* You want an example of setting up a React project from scratch, with webpack and babel. Tests run with Mocha.
* Want a quick-start for a React app.

Enjoy!
